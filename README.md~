# John conways' Game of life

First non tiny proyect made outside class assignments.

Set by default with a glider gun. Gliders and switch engines can be added too.
A generation will pass every 20000 μs by default. If usf is set to 0 or below, a generation will pass every time the enter key is pressed, and the game will finish when any caracter different from '\n' is introduced.
